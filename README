jEdit configuration files
=========================

This is my set of configuration files for jEdit text editor, you need jEdit installed in order to use the contents of this project. The configuration files are focused for develop and Ruby on Rails applications.

jEdit can be found at http://jedit.org, there you will find the correct package for your operating system


Compatibility notes
===================

The files were generated by jEdit on linux, but I already tested it on Microsoft Windows and all seems to work properly, but don't expect all working so fine as on Linux. Other java enabled Operating systems that run jEdit should work as well.

Note that on MacOS X the jEdt configuration files does not stored in ~/.jedit, but in ~/Library/jEdit

Download and Instalation
========================

To use it, make a clone of the repository in your home directory by doing:
  
  On Linux
  git clone http://github.com/lexrupy/dot_jedit.git ~/.jedit

  On MacOsX
  git clone http://github.com/lexrupy/dot_jedit.git ~/Library/jEdit
  
  
WARNING: if you already have configured something, you will need do make a backup of this folder before do the command above.

Now, you will need to install some plugins to complete the configuration. The plugins are not included in the repository for two reasons:
  1. They take a lot of unnecessary space of repository
  2. You may want to use an older or newer version of some plugin.

After install these plugins, restart jEdit and enjoy.
